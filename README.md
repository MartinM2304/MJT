Welcome to my repository for the Modern Java Technologies course 2024-2025! This repository showcases my projects, assignments, and concepts learned during the course, emphasizing my hands-on experience with Java and related technologies.

üìñ About the Course
The Modern Java Technologies course is focused on equipping students with in-depth knowledge of Java programming and its applications in modern software development. It covers advanced Java concepts, practical tools, frameworks, and best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications.

üõ† Technologies and Tools
Throughout this course, I worked with a variety of modern technologies, tools, and frameworks, including but not limited to:

Java SE & Java EE: Core Java concepts and enterprise-grade applications.
Maven/Gradle: Dependency management and project building.
JUnit & Mockito: Unit testing and mocking.
Gson/Jackson: JSON serialization and deserialization.
HTTP/REST Clients: Integration with APIs and external services.
Multithreading & Concurrency: Handling parallelism and thread-safe operations.
Streams & Lambdas: Functional programming with Java Streams API.
Collections Framework: Efficient data structures and algorithms.
Design Patterns: Clean code practices and reusable design solutions.

üí° What I Learned
This course honed my skills in:

Writing clean, maintainable, and modular code.
Leveraging Java's powerful features, including streams, concurrency, and functional programming.
Using testing frameworks (JUnit and Mockito) to ensure reliable and bug-free software.
Designing and implementing RESTful clients to consume APIs.
Applying design patterns to solve complex problems elegantly.
Debugging and troubleshooting large codebases

üìÅ Projects and Assignments
Here are some highlights of the work I completed during the course:

1. News Feed Client
Built a robust HTTP client to fetch and process data from a news API.
Used HttpClient to send and receive HTTP requests, parse JSON responses with Gson, and handle exceptions effectively.
Implemented custom error handling for deserialization and API response validation.
2. Unit Testing Suite
Developed comprehensive unit tests for custom-built Java classes using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
Created mock objects to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure code reliability.
Achieved high code coverage with precise and effective tests.
3. Multithreading Demo
Designed a multi-threaded application that processes tasks in parallel using ExecutorService and Java concurrency utilities.
Implemented synchronization to handle shared resources and prevent race conditions.
